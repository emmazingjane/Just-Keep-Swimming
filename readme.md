Code I'm proud of

function move(fish){
	var newPosition = fish.position + 40;
	fish.position = newPosition;
	fish.style.left = newPosition + 'px'; 
};

I'm proud of this code because I had to figure out the starting position and set it change every time the fish moved which was a concept I struggled with.
